# 🚩 Cybersecurity Learning Journey  
**Documenting My Practical Growth from Beginner to Cybersecurity Practitioner**


## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Offensive Security

### 🔍 What I Learned

#### 💡 What is Offensive Security?
Offensive Security focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems — before malicious attackers do.  
It includes areas like:
- Ethical Hacking
- Penetration Testing
- Red Teaming

#### 🧠 Key Terms
- **Red Team** – Simulates real-world attacks to test security.
- **Blue Team** – Defends and monitors systems from threats.
- **Penetration Testing** – Authorized simulated attacks to find vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability** – A weakness in a system or application.
- **Exploit** – Code or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
